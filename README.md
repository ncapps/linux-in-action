# Notes from Linux in Action by David Clinton
## Chapter 1. Welcome to Linux
- Linux basics:
  - the UNIX Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
  - Navigation - `ls pwd cd`
  - File management tools - `cat less touch mkdir rmdir rm cp mv`
  - Tricks - tab completion and file globbing
  - `sudo`
  - Where to find help - `man info journalctl`
- A file system uses an index to provide the appearance of an organized set of directories and files within a single disk division known as a *partition*
- All files in a disk partition are kept in directories between the root directory `/`
```
|--/           Root
|----/etc      Program configuration files
|----/var      Frequently changing content (i.e., log files)
|----/home     User account files
|----/sbin     System binary files
|----/bin      User binary files
|----/lib      Shared libraries
|----/usr      Third-party binaries
```
- The shell interprets the execution of user input commands
- *absolute path* is a path that begins with the root directory
- A pseudo file's contents are dynamically generated by the OS itself to represent specific values
- Linux uses pseudo file systems to expose data on the hardware environment to processes and users

**Key Terms**
- A *file system* is made up of data files indexed in a way that allows the perception of a directory-based organization
- A *process* is an active instance of a running software program
- A *disk partition* is the logical division of a physical storage device that can be made to work exactly like a standalone device. Partitions are common organizational tools for all modern operating systems
- *Bash* is a command-line user interface for executing system actions
- *Plain text* that is usable for administration purposes is text made up of a limited set of characters and contains no extraneous formatting code
- *File globbing* involves using wildcard characters to refer to multiple files with a single command
- *Tab completion* employs the Tab key to suggest possible completions of a partially typed command
- *Pseudo file systems* are directories containing files with dynamic data automatically generated at or after system boot

## Chapter 2. Linux Virtualization: Building a Linux working environment
- *Hypervisors* - Controls host system hardware providing each guest OS the resources it needs. Guest machines are run as system processes with virtualized access to hardware resources.
- *Containers* - Extremely lightweight virtual servers that share the underlying kernel of their host OS.
- *apt* - Advanced Package Tool
- The package manager fulfills the following responsibilities:
  - Maintains a local index to track repositories and their contents
  - Tracks the status of all the software that's installed on your local machine
  - Ensures that all available updates are applied to installed software
  - Ensures that software dependencies are met for new applications before they're installed
  - Handles installing and removing software packages
- The package manager type depends on the Linux distribution
- Run `arch` to check if the operating system is 64-bit or 32-bit
- It's always a good idea to update the repo information before installing new software
- A *dependency* is software that must already be installed on your computer for a new package to work
- Change password with `passwd`

**Summary**
- Hypervisors like VirtualBox provide an environment where virtual operating systems can safely access hardware resources, whereas lightweight containers share their hosts's software kernel
- Linux package managers like APT and RPM (Yum) oversee the installation and administration of software from curated online repositories using a regularly updated index that mirrors the state of the remote repository
- Getting a VM going in VirtualBox requires defining its virtual hardware environment, downloading an OS image, and installing the OS on your VM
- LXC containers are built on predefined, distribution-based templates
- LXC data is stored within the host file system, making it easy to administer containers

**Key Terms**
- *Virtualization* is the logical sharing of compute, storage, and networking resources among multiple processes, allowing each to run as if it was a standalone physical computer
- A *hypervisor* is software running on a host machine that exposes system rsources to a guest layer, allowing the launching and administration of full-stack guest VMs
- A *container* is a VM that shares the host machine's core OS kernal. Containers are fast and easy to launch and kill
- A *software repository* is a location where digital resources can be stored. Repositories are useful for collaboration and distribution of software packages

**Security Best Practices**
- It is preferred to use an official package manager to install and maintain software on your Linux system
- Always scan the checksum hashes of downloaded files against the correct hash strings, packages could be corrupted during download or switched by man-in-the-middle attackers

**Command Line Review**
- `apt install PACKAGE_NAME` installs a software package from a remote repository
- `dpkg -i PACKAGE_NAME` installs a downloaded Debian package on a Ubuntu machine
- `wget FILE_LOCATION` downloads a file
- `apt update` syncs the local software index with what's available from online repositories
- `shasum PACKAGE_NAME` calculates the checksum for a downloaded file
- `ip addr` displays information on each of a system's network interfaces
