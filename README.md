# Notes from Linux in Action by David Clinton
## Chapter 1. Welcome to Linux
- Linux basics:
  - the UNIX Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
  - Navigation - `ls pwd cd`
  - File management tools - `cat less touch mkdir rmdir rm cp mv`
  - Tricks - tab completion and file globbing
  - `sudo`
  - Where to find help - `man info journalctl`
- A file system uses an index to provide the appearance of an organized set of directories and files within a single disk division known as a *partition*
- All files in a disk partition are kept in directories between the root directory `/`
```
|--/           Root
|----/etc      Program configuration files
|----/var      Frequently changing content (i.e., log files)
|----/home     User account files
|----/sbin     System binary files
|----/bin      User binary files
|----/lib      Shared libraries
|----/usr      Third-party binaries
```
- The shell interprets the execution of user input commands
- *absolute path* is a path that begins with the root directory
- A pseudo file's contents are dynamically generated by the OS itself to represent specific values
- Linux uses pseudo file systems to expose data on the hardware environment to processes and users

*Key Terms*
- A *file system* is made up of data files indexed in a way that allows the perception of a directory-based organization
- A *process* is an active instance of a running software program
- A *disk partition* is the logical division of a physical storage device that can be made to work exactly like a standalone device. Partitions are common organizational tools for all modern operating systems
- *Bash* is a command-line user interface for executing system actions
- *Plain text* that is usable for administration purposes is text made up of a limited set of characters and contains no extraneous formatting code
- *File globbing* involves using wildcard characters to refer to multiple files with a single command
- *Tab completion* employs the Tab key to suggest possible completions of a partially typed command
- *Pseudo file systems* are directories containing files with dynamic data automatically generated at or after system boot
